Yashas Pasumarthi- F27IR Coursework


The purpose of my website is very straight forward; To provide a website to allow users to compare iPhone attributes to make a decision. I have used a simple and minimal colour scheme that will appeal to all audiences and does not look too bizarre. I have implemented the DOM model into my website by creating a JSON data structure and extracting information from it, and using this extracted information in elements such as drop-down scroll boxes. My website also has mobile first techniques implemented to make sure that the website can be used on any size of device and the elements on the page can fit the screen size. I have done this by using the media tag within my css. My HTML is very modular as I have used several div tags where possible to separate the tasks and styles of the content on the website. The website is user-friendly as there is not a lot of content on the webpage which makes it not cluttered and very pleasant to navigate through. I have also created a menu bar on the top of the webpages for easy navigation across the website. I decided to create an about  web page to allow users to access the phone's respective external webpage to access a full specification. This About webpage is neatly presented in a grid format that will adapt its dimensions to the size of the device so it can be accessible by all.
